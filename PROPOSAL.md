# Project Description:
For our Unit 1 project we will be making a rogue-like dungeon crawler titled "Asunder".  We have love for rpgs and other alike. The story is based off Dante's Inferno, Layers of Hell with our own twist to it.  For the reason of creating this is that there is not many rogue-like games based of off the Layers of Hell.  

# Prior Art:
Our inspirations were of course Dante's Inferno, along with elements of HP Lovecraft and previous rpgs we have worked on in module projects.

# Core User Workflow:
The user interacts by adventuring the areas and making purchases from shops.  The user battles enemies by selecting a move and "attacking" and can deal a certain amount of damage.  Enemies can attack and damage the player as well.  Certain player choices can affect the difficulty of the boss fight.
  
# Tuesday thru Thurday Daily Goals:
On Tuesday we finish outlining the structure and deciding what would finally go into the project.  On Wednesday,  finish the fights and have enemies assigned health values and attack values.  On Thursday,  we finish putting in the shops where you can but healing items, spells, and level up.  

# How Will You Utilize The Content Covered This Unit: 
We will use the content in this unit by using a dataclass to store enemies and the player, have the battles and locations stored in functions, and using loops within functions for various purposes such as within a dungeon or while the player is picking certain options.
