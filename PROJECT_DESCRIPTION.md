# Unit Project

For the last week of the unit, you will be assigned a partner to start and finish a cumulative project of your pairâ€™s design. Before lunch on Monday, your pair will submit a proposal that describes of the product you will build over the week. By the end of the week, your repl should have a README that describes the product and provides example usage. At the end of the week your pair will be required to present this project to the class.

## Schedule

- **Monday:** Write and submit your project proposal before lunch. Respond to feedback in order to have your proposal accepted by the end of the day. The proposal should be in `PROPOSAL.md` in your repl.
- **Tuesday-Thursday:** Development time. Follow through on your project proposal schedule. Respond to instructor feedback.
- **Friday:** Wrap up, README, and presentation. Ensure your project meets expectations according to your accepted proposal and the feedback you have during the week. Write a README to help others understand your project. Prepare and deliver a presentation about your project and submit a reflection of your project and presentation.

## Example Project Ideas

- Build a small game, but add a twist!
    - Rock, Paper, Scissors, but with 4 options
    - Tic-Tac-Toe, but you can't see what has already been played
- Automate data collection and processing tasks
    - How many gas cards does BCCA need to buy next week?
    - How many groceries do we need to buy each week?
- Automate a paper form process. A lot of software is simply digitizing an existing paper workflow. For example, you can build something to manage:
    - Job listings and applications
    - Apartment repair requests
    - Project proposals and bids

## Monday Requirements: Project Proposal

- **Project Description and Motivation:** Your project proposal should include a description of the project and its motivation. This should answer "What" and "Why" questions about your project. If a reader does not understand what you are building or why you are building it, you need to do more work on this section.
- **Prior Art:** Everything is built based on a collection of other experiences. Your project proposal should describe your project's relationship to other similar projects. This should compare and contrast your proposed project with two other similar projects.
- **Core User Workflows:** Your project proposal should describe the core user workflows that your project should support. This should give more specific details on exactly what you plan to build. Just as importantly, it will give insight into what you are not building.
- **Tuesday-Thursday Daily Goals:** Your project proposal should outline your daily development goals. These goals should be described in terms of your core user workflows. They should also be simple to validate.
- **How Will You Utilize The Content Covered This Unit:** Unit projects serve as a summary demonstration of your mastery of the unit, and the project proposal should provide a brief outline of how you expect to use the content from the current unit. This outline should communicate that you are aware of the content from the unit, you understand the use cases for the content, and that your project gives you the opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the content.

## Tuesday-Thursday Requirements: Development

Everyday should show significant progress consistent with your proposal's daily goals. Before the end of first block each day, you should email your instructor a brief outline of what you plan to accomplish that day. This should be based heavily on your proposal's daily goals.

## Friday Requirements: Wrap-up and Presentation

No coding should be done on Friday. Before the first break on Friday (9:40), your project should include a helpful README and you and your partner should have a 3-4 minute presentation on your project prepared. When we return from break (10:00), all pairs will present their projects to the class.  Following the presentations, you will submit a reflection form for your project and presentation.
