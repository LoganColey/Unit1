# Unit 1 Project: Asunder

Asunder is a rogue-like dungeon crawler game.  It is based loosely off of The Devine Comedy Dante's Interno

## Why we chose it:

We both love mythology and Logan loves rogue-like games and we really wanted to make this type of game.


## Gameplay

```python
Name: Dante
Welcome Dante
A pale white forest lays before you with a pale blue glow srounding you and the forest.  You feel a strange sensation around you as your body is enveloped in the strange blue light. 
You can go to:
Old Town
Cathedral
Decent
Where would Dante like to go?

```

It is a text-based adventure game with rogue-like elements.  The user can buy things from a shop, level up, and battle the first two demons of the 7 layers of Hell.
